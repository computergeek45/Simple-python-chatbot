This AI Chatbot project represents an introduction to integrating large language models into real-world applications. 
It includes two implementations: a Python Flask backend chatbot using the Groq API with session-based conversation handling, and a frontend-only version built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that communicates directly with the API. 
Both versions share a modern animated chat UI with avatars, typing indicators, and smooth message transitions. 
The project demonstrates early understanding of chatbot architecture, API integration, session handling, and conversational UI design.
